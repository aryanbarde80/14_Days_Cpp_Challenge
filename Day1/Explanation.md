# Glitch Pattern Checker

This program checks if a **glitch pattern** exists in a **video stream**.

## How It Works
1. The program asks you to input:
   - A **video stream** (a string of data).
   - A **glitch pattern** (a smaller sequence you're looking for inside the video stream).
   
2. It then checks if the glitch pattern exists within the video stream.

3. The program prints:
   - `true` if the glitch pattern is found.
   - `false` if it is not found.

## Code Breakdown
- **Input:** You provide two strings: the video stream and the glitch pattern.
- **Search:** The program uses the `find` function to check if the glitch pattern is part of the video stream.
  - The `find` function searches for the glitch pattern inside the video stream. If it finds the pattern, it returns the position where the pattern starts.
  - If the pattern is not found, the `find` function returns `string::npos`, which is a constant representing an invalid position, indicating that the pattern is not present in the string.
- **Output:** The result is printed as `true` if the glitch pattern is found (i.e., `find` does not return `npos`), or `false` if it is not found (i.e., `find` returns `npos`).
